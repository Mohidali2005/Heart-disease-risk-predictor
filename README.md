Heart Disease Risk Predictor

This project explores the use of machine learning models to predict the presence of heart disease using clinical patient data. A baseline Decision Tree and a Neural Network model are implemented, with evaluation focused on minimizing false negatives for medical screening.

For a detailed explanation of the dataset, please refer to the attached PDF report included in this repository.
